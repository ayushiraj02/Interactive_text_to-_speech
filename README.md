# Interactive_text_to-_speech
This repository contains the implementation of a VoiceChatbot with text-to-speech functionality. The chatbot collects user details for booking appointments, processes dates, converts month names provided in English to their corresponding numeric values, and handles user remarks. The project is developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
